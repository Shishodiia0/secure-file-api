# 🔐 Secure File Sharing System

This is a secure backend file-sharing system built with **FastAPI** that handles role-based access between two types of users: **Ops Users** and **Client Users**. It enforces strict file type control, secure access tokens, and encrypted download links.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔑 JWT-based authentication
- 👥 Role-based access control (Ops / Client)
- 📁 File upload (Ops-only: `.pptx`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`)
- 🔗 Secure encrypted file download links for Clients
- 📜 Email verification flow (mocked)
- 📂 List uploaded files (Client-only)
- 📦 Swagger UI for API testing

---

## 👥 User Roles & Capabilities

### 🛠 Ops User
- Login
- Upload files (`.pptx`, `.docx`, `.xlsx` only)

### 👤 Client User
- Sign Up (returns an encrypted download link)
- Email Verification (mocked)
- Login
- View list of uploaded files
- Download a file via a secure encrypted link (Client-only)
